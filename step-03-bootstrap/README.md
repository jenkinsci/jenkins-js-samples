# Simple bootstrap plugin example

To use this: 

1) ensure npm (at least version 4) is install  and gulp is also installed
2) run `npm install` in this directory
3) run `gulp rebundle` to watch for changes (this leaves a process running)
4) run `mvn hpi:run` to launch Jenkins with the plugin. Any changes you make to the JS stuff will be picked up by gulp in real time.
