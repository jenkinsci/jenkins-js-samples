This repository provides some sample Jenkins Plugins, showing how to use [jenkins-js-builder] to build
Jenkins plugins that support a richer UI through the use of Modularized JavaScript.

The repository contains step-by-step example plugins, starting with <a href="../../tree/master/step-01-basic">step-01-basic</a>,
which is just a simple Jenkins plugin that contains no JavaScript at all, working up through steps 02 and 03 etc,
incrementally adding more JavaScript "features".
